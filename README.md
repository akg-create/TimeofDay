#Dynamic Time-Based Webpage - Abbie Grooms 
## Overview 
  This webpage changes its background based on the time of day using JavaScript. It includes basic information and a greeting.
## Time-Based Logic
  -Morning (6am-12pom): Cornsilk (#FFF8DC)
  -Afternoon(12pm-6pm): Light Blue (#ADD8E6)
  -Evening(6pm -9pm): Light Pink (#FFB6C1)
  -Night(9pm-6am): Dark Slate Gray (#2F4F4F)

## Design Choices
  I used soft and distinct colors that reflect the feel of each time period. I found the colors used by researching HTML color 
  codes. The page layout is centered and response using CSS. 
## Deployment
  This page is hosted on GitHub Pages: 

## Known Issues/Assumptions
  The script uses the user's system time. 
  No external JS file is used; all scripts are embedded.
